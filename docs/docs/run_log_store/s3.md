# S3 Run Log store

This package is an extension to [magnus](https://github.com/AstraZeneca/magnus-core).

## Provides 
Provides the functionality to use S3 buckets as run log stores.

## Installation instructions

```pip install magnus_extension_datastore_s3```

## Set up required to use the extension

Access to AWS environment either via:

- AWS profile, generally stored in ~/.aws/credentials
- AWS credentials available as environment variables

If you are using environmental variables for AWS credentials, please set:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: AWS access key
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: AWS access secret
- AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: The session token, useful to assume other roles

A S3 bucket that you want to use to store the run log store.

Since the run log would be modified frequently as part of the run, we recommend 
[switching off versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) of files in
the S3 bucket.


## Config parameters
